Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol to access other computers. It was invented in
1995 to make the old methods more secure but, on first glance, it still behaves
similar to remote shell or telnet from the eighties: you can connect to a remote
computer to enter commands in a terminal. In the simplest case, you will just
type the name of the computer you want to connect to:

```bash
ssh username@servername.domain
```

However, SSH has become much more powerful than this if you know how to use it
correctly. In the following, we will try to go through all the helpful features
you should know when working remotely.

But first we need to talk a bit about security, especially encryption.

Asymmetric Encryption
---------------------

One cornerstone technology of the current internet is asymmetric cryptography,
or public-key cryptography. We all use it constantly
without caring about it when browsing the web, but it's also important for the efficient usage of SSH,
so we need to go through some key features of it.

The idea behind asymmetric encryption is to have two distinct, different keys
for encryption. One key can encrypt the message and then only the other key can
decrypt the message. In practice, we will keep one of these keys private and publish the other.

As an example, let's say we have two people, Alice and Bob, where Alice owns the private key and
Bob has the public key. Then, with this key pair, they can perform two things:

**Confidentiality**
   * Bob can send confidential information only intended for Alice by encrypting
   it with the public key. Only Alice has the private key to decrypt it and
   nobody else can see the content of the message (left side of the figure).

**Authentication**
   * To establish the identity of Alice, Bob gives Alice a message to encrypt with
   her private key. Bob can then decrypt it with his public key to be sure he
   talks to Alice as only she would have been able to encrypt the message (right
   side of the figure).
   * This is the one you are using almost everywhere in the internet:
   every *https* connection on the internet uses this principle to make sure that the
   server claiming to be "netflix.com" is actually the real Netflix server. And this is also what we use for SSH connections.


Following this example, consider a string of numbers from `1435706`. Now for
encryption, we could just "add" a value to each of these digits and take the
modulus by 10 to get another digit, $$f_{k}(x) = (x + k) \bmod 10$$

Now, if we choose as keys $$A=3$$ and $$B=7$$, then we can "encrypt" the
message by applying $$f_A(x)$$ on each digit to get the encrypted message,
`4768039`. And we can decrypt it again by applying $$f_B(x)$$ to get the
original message, `1435706`. This also works by first applying $$f_B(x)$$
and then $$f_A(x)$$.

So, if we encrypt a message with one key, we need to use the other key to decrypt the
message again and vice versa. Now, this example is obviously way too simple but
it is actually rather close to the [RSA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) still used today.
