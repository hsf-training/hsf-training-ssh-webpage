This tutorial requires a "shell" or "terminal" program. Below are instructions for installing this program on different operating systems. For more information on how to use the terminal program, see [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

### Windows Installation and Access

If you are using Windows 10 version 1809 or a more recent version of the Windows OS, then you have access to a Windows SSH program called OpenSSH. More information about OpenSSH can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui).

If you are using an older version of Windows, you will need to install [the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). WSL has the ssh programs you need by default, so once you've installed WSL you are ready for this tutorial.

### Mac Installation and Access

For macOS, this application is called Terminal. To open Terminal, you can either

* Open 'Finder', select the 'Go' menu, then select 'Utilties'. In the 'Utilities' folder you should be able to find and open 'Terminal'.

* Use the Mac 'Spotlight' computer search function. Search for 'Terminal' and press `RETURN`.

More information about how to use the Terminal application in macOS can be found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

### Linux Installation and Access

For Linux, you can access the terminal from the application menu or the search bar. For most Debian and Ubuntu based systems, `CTRL + ALT + T` will also open the terminal application.
